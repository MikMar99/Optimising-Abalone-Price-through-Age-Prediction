# <center> **Regression with an Abalone Dataset**
### <center> Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 4 (<a href=(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e4/overview >Source: Kaggle</a>)


**Project Overview:** The goal of this kaggle challenge is to predict the age of abalones from various physical measurements. The dataset provided (both train and test) were generated from a deep learning model trained on <a href=(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone >the original Abalone dataset</a>. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.
